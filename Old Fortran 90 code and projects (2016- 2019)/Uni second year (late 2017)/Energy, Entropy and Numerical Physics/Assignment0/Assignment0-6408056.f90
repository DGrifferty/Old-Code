!This program uses the modified euler method to numerically iterate an ODE between r=0 and t=50
!The ODES model a mass m attached to a spring. The program calculates m's x position and velocity
!It does this in 5E-3 steps of time and plots 10001 steps to a file called results.dat

Allocate(T(0:npts), X(0:npts), V(0:npts))!Creating arrays to store the data

X(0)=0; V(0)=2.0; T(0)=0; h=5.0E-3 !Setting intial boundary conditions
